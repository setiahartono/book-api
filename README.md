# Book API

## Overview

An API to facilitate book pickup schedule to prevent overcapacity during pandemic time. To prevent widespreak outbreak it is safer to propose pickup quota in a timeslot in a crowd control attempt. A user should be able to make books pickup on proposed schedule. Should the user be able to book a schedule successfuly, the timeslot quota will be reduced by one, thus preventing another user to book the mentioned timeslot whenever the quota hits zero.


This API was made by using Go 1.18 without any persistent storage (only making use of Array as a means of storage). The data state is highly simulated with dummy record to illustrate simple API creation by using Go.

This repository included both the API and the unit test.

## How to run

### Running Go directly

- Make sure that Go is properly installed `go version`

- Install dependencies `go mod tidy` and `go mod download`

- Run the server by accessing the root directory and type `go run .`

#### Running with Docker

- Make sure that you have Docker installed `docker -v`

- Build the Docker Image, type `docker build . && docker-compose build --no-cache`

- Run the container, type `docker-compose up`

## The Unit Test

- Just go to the root directory

- Run `go test ./api/tests/`

- The test cases can be viewed at `api/tests` folder

## The API

The followings are the short documentation of the API.
